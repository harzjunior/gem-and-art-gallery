    subtitle: 'Cole Harrell on "FEMME" and Classical African Art',
    date: "June 2024",
    intro:
      'FOA\'s Laura Day Webb in conversation with Classical African Art Dealer, Cole Harrell on his latest exhibition "FEMME" now on view through June 30th at Harrell Fine Art in NYC.',
    content: [
      {
        question: "What initially drew you to classical African art?",
        answer:
          "I first became interested in African Art as a boy growing up in Texas. Being from the Houston area, I was fortunate to be surrounded by several world-class institutional collections, including the HMFA and The Menil Collection. Both museums contain very strong holdings in classical African Art. I was an actor at the time, and I found such resonance with African masks/ theatre. From there my passion grew, and to this day I find that the field of African Art contains everything I enjoy learning about: theatre, dance, ethnology, social anthropology, sculpture, art history, botany, zoology, religion...the list goes on.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Tell us a bit about your current exhibition, FEMME and its focus on the feminine within classical African art?",
        answer:
          "Our current exhibition, FEMME, is one I am particularly proud of. The show celebrates the feminine through masterworks of classical African Sculpture. I have been carefully building this show over the last several years, so to see it finally take wings and soar is a real joy. With the times as they are now globally, I felt it was timely and prudent to shine a light on feminine power and beauty and celebrate it. African sculptors have famously venerated the female form in their work so it seemed a natural choice. The show is up until June 30th at our space in Chelsea.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Is there a particular piece from the exhibition that resonates with you most and, if so, why?",
        answer:
          "This is a very tough question since there are several works in this show I love, and am extremely proud to be representing. If I had to narrow it down to just one, I would say the Baga d'mba Yambam mask from Guinea. Sculpted by a Baga sculptor at the turn of the century, these masks, made famous by artists like Picasso who owned one and directly took influence from it in his paintings and sculpture, are icons in the canon of African Art. They are also exceedingly rare, with only about 30 authentic examples known, and furthermore only 5 of the same type as the present example have been identified. The example in our show was acquired in situ by the famous collector Emil Storrer while he was in Baga country in the early 1950's, and was lost to the field of African Art until being re-discovered in 2023. I find myself struck with awe at the present work's presence, grace, strength; the patina present is a testament to its long ritual use in situ. It is a masterpiece that carries a timeless beauty and power that I am certain will continue to inspire future art admirers for generations to come.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Classical African art has inspired generations of artists globally and you have been known to showcase contemporary work in tandem with it in some of your exhibitions. Are there certain contemporary artists that particularly resonate with you right now?",
        answer:
          "Great question. As you know I have built my career as a specialist in Classical African works of art, so when I started featuring works by contemporary Diasporic artists, I was presented with the chance to fall in love with the field in a completely new way, to approach the work from a fresh angle and see through the lens and interpret artists working now in addition to artists of the 19th century has been a real joy. Contemporary African art as a collecting category has blossomed.",

    intro:
      "Cole Harrell has been dealing Sub-Saharan African art for more than a decade...but you might not guess it. As an openly gay member of the New York social scene, Harrell leads a lifestyle as stunning and curated as his bespoke exhibitions. This spring, in tandem with Mother's Day, Harrell held an event at his Chelsea penthouse that boldly celebrated the sacred feminine through African masterpieces, aptly titled 'FEMME'.",

'African sculptors have famously venerated the female form in their work, so it seemed a natural choice' Harrell explains. 'Through their artistry, classical African sculptors sought to honor the divine feminine in all her manifestations,' the press release begins, 'From the nurturing mother to the fierce warrior; from the wise elder to the playful maiden. At the heart of FEMME lies a celebration of the sacred mysteries of womanhood – the primal forces of creation and destruction, nurturing and protection, birth and rebirth.'",
      },
      {
        text: "Harrell's selection depicts motherhood, healing, and powerful journeys along the fault lines of fertility, from sisterhood of community to the deification of the individual. Objects celebrating fertility include a Nkisi figure from the Bwende culture in Democratic Republic of Congo, a Luba-Zela khona stool, a Dan gunyege mask, and a d'mba Yamban mask from Guinea, by a Baga sculptor.",
      },
      {
        text: "A catalogue essay by Aurora Mariani explains the d'mba goddess as one of generosity. Literally transliterated as the \"good spirit,\" her supple, milk-filled form is believed to express a Baga beauty ideal, and thus, in her fertility, the community's survival in abundant harvests during sacrifices and offerings for prosperity. Speaking of the Baga figure, Mariani summates: \"She is the Mother of mothers in all her splendor and beauty.\" The d'mba have been known in the West since the 17th century, with items from their tradition historically held in France. Mariani's essay explores the history of the people, explaining how migration to Guinea underscored the importance of a female anchor. Citing the 'femme people, she translates, \"the world was created by the spirit of the woman, she is the origin of life\" (Lamp, 1982, p.244-283). \"Thus, wearing the mask was synonymous with carrying life,\" she writes. \"To the point that when giving birth, according to Sayers (1927: 111) women would say 'I po sara a-ron,' which literally translates to 'I have carried the mask on my head.'\" An accompanying dance for ceremonies evolved slowly, as few examples were made to protect the sanctity of the object. Picasso owned a similar mask from the Baga region, purchased in 1920, which is said to have inspired his depictions of Marie-Therese. Harrell's selection is one of four in its exact style, originally owned by a Swiss collector named Emil Storrer who acquired it in its original territory sometime in the 1950s. One of his acquisitions is currently at the Kreiger Museum in Washington, D.C., and another the Rietberg Museum in his home city of Zurich.",
      },
      {
        text: "While FEMME indisputably honors all things woman, Harrell was certain to acknowledge the 'often fluid nature of gender as it relates to classical African sculpture,' citing a Nigerian sculptr of Eshu, the benevolent Yoruba messenger from the heavens and a trickster god. Harrell shared that Eshu is traditionally presented as male, requiring constant appeasement to continue his conveying of sacrifices and divining the future. While Eshu is almost always depicted as male, Harrell selected a rare sculpture presenting the deity as female, with full breasts and an infant carried on the back. Harrell cited scholar Ayodele Ogundipe, noting Eshu is ultimately genderless, embodying both male and female traits. 'Eshu's indeterminacy sits at the heart of Yoruba hermeneutics, an approach to truth that leaves meaning open-ended and unresolved,' Ogundipe asserts.",

The Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro had opened in Paris in 1882, but it was a small group of avant-garde artists in the first decade of the 20th century who awoke to the aesthetic quality of these artefacts. Maurice de Vlaminck, Henri Matisse, and André Derain bought a handful of objects that have become iconic, both in terms of the history of modernism and the Western reception of African tribal art. Picasso saw Matisse's Congolese figure at the home of Gertrude Stein and was inspired to visit the Trocadéro, producing, in response, the revolutionary painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. Cubism was born.",

But it is consistently works from the Gabon and the different tribal groups that inhabit the vast Congo region, alongside works from Ivory Coast, that command the highest prices. The surge of prices witnessed over the last 15 years has not changed this focus.

But the second highest is the £6.1m paid last July for the beautifully designed and carved Luba female figure for a bowstand, from what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is one of just nine works ascribed to the Warua Master, who made works for Luba royalty and was identified as long ago as 1904 by the pioneering German ethnographer, Leo Frobenius. Other outstanding prices include the Luba male statue, also by the Warua Master, which sold in May last year for $3.6m; the Gabonese Fang mask from the Pierre Vérité collection, which achieved €5.9m – a record at the time – in Paris in 2006; the Luba female carved stool by the legendary Master of the Buli, sold in 2010 for €5.4m; and the Kongo-Yombe maternity figure by the Master of Kasadi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, which sold in May for $3.3m. Fred Backlar of Bonhams comments: 'From the early 20th century on, works from the Fang and Kota in Gabon and works from the Luba, Lega and Yombe cultures in the Democratic Republic of Congo have typically been most sought after by most collectors of African art.'",

Guillaume's love for the deep brown, wooden sculpture with its strong, curvilinear, plastic qualities spread to America: he was the major lender to a pioneering 1914 exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz's gallery 291, and advised the collector Dr Albert Barnes. As Kloman comments: 'He extolled the virtues of the best of what was available to them.' She adds that despite the huge expansion in the market, with works still being discovered by Westerners up until the 1970s, and the tremendous growth in scholarship, 'these pieces have stood the test of time. They hold their own in a classical sense'.",

Kloman reports: 'Seven of 11 lots sold for $5m – and every buyer was a crossover buyer, with two new to us.'

A wacky George II mahogany armchair, likely of Irish origin, was top lot, selling for $437,000, though numerous pieces clocked in at less than $30,000. The Met's imprimatur almost certainly helped because English antiques and lackluster results frequently go hand in hand.
